#Socket Express

Howdy! To use this shit run the following commands:

```
# Install the required node modules
npm init

# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Launch the server
npm run server
```

Now visit the URL displayed in your console and you have your self a chat. Open it in two different tabs and you can chat with yourself! What a time to be alive! 

## Credits

I couldn't have done this without my computer, "you're always there for me, buddy!"
I want to thank Bohren & Der Club of Gore for fueling my insanity while coding
Last, but not least, my Oculus Rift. If I didn't code with my headset on I'd be done a lot earlier, and with less headache and nausea.
